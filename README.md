# Lung-Cancer-Cell-Prediction
Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate 
diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project uses ensemble learning 
to enhance the classification of cancerous lung cells from microscopic images.
A dataset containing images of lung cells categorized as Neuroendocrine 
Tumors, Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.. Four pre-trained 
deep learning models - ResNet, VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet - were 
employed for individual cell classification.
The ensemble learning techniques used are average ensembling and weighted 
average ensembling. Average ensembling combines the predictions from all 
models, while weighted ensembling assigns weights based on each model's 
individual performance.
